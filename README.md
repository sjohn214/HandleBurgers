# HandleBurgers

The purpose of this application is to create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. This project will follow the MVC design pattern by using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the application, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.


# Project Description
To create an application that can be used to track burgers that will be prepared to devoure and indicate status after devour button is pressed. Application will connect remotely to a Heroku database and will feature Node, Express, MySQL, and Handlebars.

# Summary
* In this project we created an application that will allow users to dynamically interact with a burger program. Users will "order" a burger/s, then the burgers will appear in a waiting area on the application, finally the user will be prompted to select the devour button to consume the burger or not. Devoured burgers will be removed from the waiting area.
